This repository supports studies, related to vision-enhanced floating car data (vision-xFCD).

The main purpose of the repository is to ensure robust and reproducable research results.


Introduction
----------------
We propose an enhancement of conventional FCD with car vision data, captured by the probe car using deployed cameras or lidar detectors. The resulting vision-xFCD data have a potential to improve urban traffic forecasting, classification, congestion detection and other transport engineering problems.
